** Requirements
Download and install Simple Build Tool (SBT). Files and instructions for your platform are available at the project website, http://www.scala-sbt.org/.

To run the program go into the project root and run using:
#+begin_src shell
sbt run
#+end_src

** Running

Configure the SUL in the main file [[file:src/main/scala/main.scala::val%20sul:%20SUL%20=%20modelName%20match%20{][here]]. The SUL takes as parameters: the model, a simulator, specifications if needed, a flag stating if the intention is to learn a plant or a supervisor (this flag is currently redundant) and a boolean value if the model is supposed to accept partial states. Set the model to learn, solver name and other relevant configuration in the [[file://src/main/resources/application.conf][application.conf]].

The model files are created under the [[file:src/main/scala/modelbuilding/models][models folder]] using traits specified in [[file:src/main/scala/modelbuilding/core][core folder]].

Provide the name of the model [[file:src/main/scala/main.scala::val%20modelName%20=%20"TestUnit"][here]] and the solver you want to use [[file:src/main/scala/main.scala::val%20solver:%20String%20=%20"LStarSuprLearner"%20//%20"modular",%20"mono"][here]] and run the program using ~sbt run.~
